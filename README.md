# Super-NES
Super Nova Explosion Solver (Super_NES) is a tool to numerically solve the self-similar shock structure of a large number of different SN models parametrized by their expansion velocity index alpha, the shock strength u and the adiabatic index.

The code repository already has some built-in functionality to display and store images of the solutions and do some analysis of peculiar properties (like shock location) but of course there are infinite ways how this could be extended.
I therefore recommend users to extend the code for their purposes.

The employed numerical method is simple and it is quite possible that numerical errors will appear and propagate. 
I thus caution users that the results may be inaccurate and should be subject to diligent scrutiny.
